//! Document blame — `git blame` at **document-address** granularity.
//!
//! `git blame` answers "who last changed this line". For a `.xlsx` or a `.pdf` there are no lines:
//! git reports `Binary files differ` and stops. The prevailing workaround is a `textconv` diff
//! driver that shells out to `pandoc` / `unoconv` once per file per revision and flattens the
//! document to a throwaway line stream — so the number you get back is a line of the *rendering*,
//! not an address in the document.
//!
//! This module answers the question in the document's own coordinate system instead:
//!
//! ```text
//! Sheet1!B14   a3f91c2e  2026-03-04  <author>  quarterly figures
//! p. 7         5d10ba71  2026-01-19  <author>  redraft the appendix
//! ```
//!
//! How it works: walk the revisions that touched the file (`git log --follow`), materialise each
//! revision's blob (`git show <rev>:<path-at-that-rev>`), parse every revision **in-process** with
//! the `zoffice-core` / `zpdf-core` engines already linked into this host (see `doc_search.rs`,
//! which owns the same parsers for search/replace), and attribute each address to the newest
//! revision at which that address's content differs from its predecessor's. No subprocess per
//! revision beyond `git` itself, and no external converter.
//!
//! # Scope, stated plainly
//!
//! Only **stable** addresses are blamed: spreadsheet cells ([`DocLocator::Cell`]) and PDF pages
//! ([`DocLocator::Page`]). Paragraph and slide indices *shift* when content is inserted above them,
//! so index-keyed attribution would mis-blame every unit below an insertion — a wrong answer that
//! looks right. Those formats are refused with an explanation rather than answered badly. Fixing
//! them needs content-hash alignment between adjacent revisions, which is not in this pass.
//!
//! # Truncation, stated plainly
//!
//! The walk is capped ([`DEFAULT_REV_CAP`]). The oldest revision walked has no predecessor inside
//! the window, so every address that has not changed within the window attributes *to* it — which
//! would be a lie if real history runs deeper. Those rows carry [`DocBlameEntry::at_or_before`],
//! and the result carries the revision counts, so the UI can say "at or before" instead of
//! asserting an authorship it cannot see. Same convention as `doc_search.rs`'s `whole_run_only`
//! rows: surface the limit, never hide it.
